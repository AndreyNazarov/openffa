Map list format
---------------

Map list is loaded at server startup from  `./openffa/mapcfg/${g_maps_file}.txt`.
Each line of the map list file should have the following format:
`<mapname> [min_players] [max_players] [flags]`. Minimum and maximum player
counts are optional, as well as flags. Flags can be either 1 or 2, which makes
the map entry not automatically selectable and not votable, respectively.
